    <br> 4. Finalised and agreed our MVP 
    <br> 5. Segregation of duties
</details>
<details>
<summary> Designing and building </summary>
    <br> - On Figma, we built the website pages
    <br> - Using the pages we designed, we extracted the main functions and data points
    <br> - Discussed and agreed on the linkages of each data and functions
    <br> - Built the ERD and generated the datasets
    <br> - Created the assets needed for the application
    <br> - Began working on each page and creating the functions, testing along the way
</details>


## Wins & Challenges

### Wins
- Agreeing on a ways of working for the team before starting on building the application
- Assignment of tasks are confirmed during our stand-downs to ensure clarity amongst the team, in addition, allowing for flexibility of support where possible to reassign
- No clashes/conflicts when pushing and merging into development
- Great collaboration within the team which mean little to no conflict and bugs were addressed right away


### Challenges
- Figuring out our MVP
- Protection of the 'main' branch, had instances of pushing to the main instead of the development branch by accident
- Designing the Frontend without the use of Bootstrap
- Storing information in localStorage
- Setting up the relationship between the topics and quiz table
- Display information from the database to the correct place on the webpage


### Bugs
- Testing bug in regards to localStorgage (doesn't affect the functionality of the application but will cause some errors during testing)

### Accessibility Features

2. Protanopia (Red-blind) – The yellow/orange tones become more muted, blending more with the background.
3. Deuteranopia (Green-blind) – Similar to protanopia, with reduced vibrancy in green and yellow areas.
4. Tritanopia (Blue-blind) – This one causes the clouds and steps to look reddish.
